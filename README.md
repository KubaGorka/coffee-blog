# _Coffee Blog_

### This project was created using **React** and Firebase.
The main goal of this project was to create a full-stack application with user authentication.
By creating this app I hope to practice usage of context and further improve in TypeScript.

### What's in this project:
By the end of this project I would like to create a blog app in which users can create new posts, share their photos and customize their prfiles.

If the app's up, you can find it here: [LINK]
